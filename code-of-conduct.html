<p>
We would like to ask that all of you read through the following points, and by participating in this school you agree to follow this code.  Basically we are a very diverse group and it is important to be aware that there are cultural differences, and we want to be sure everyone is treated with respect.  If there are conflicts or concerns with another student or teacher, please bring them to the attention of one of the organizers (Daniela, Enrico, Nicole, Sera) or the conference ombudsperson (tbd).
</p>

								<h3 class="major">Code of Conduct</h3>

<p><b>Collective success. </b>  
Rather than seeing this school as competitive, we encourage you to view the group as a collective whose success is determined by the success of all.  If you notice a fellow student struggling, please try to help.
</p>
<p>
<b>Respect the preferred pronouns of others. </b> 
To help make sure that nobody is singled out, please include your preferred pronouns on your badge. If you're not sure what this means or how to do this, please ask.
</p>

<p>
<b>Share the air. </b> 
If you have been dominating the discussion or participating disproportionately, let others participate. Alternatively, if you haven't said much, you are encouraged to participate more.
</p>

<p>
<b>Recognize that intent ≠ impact. </b> 
We can generally assume that nearly all of us have good intentions. However, sometimes we end up saying or doing something that is hurtful even when we have good intentions.
</p>

<p>
<b>Oops, ouch. </b>
If you say something that is hurtful or problematic to someone at the school, and you realize it, you can say “oops” to acknowledge it and then try again. Alternatively, if someone else said something hurtful or problematic, then you can say “ouch” which serves as a marker that there is something that needs to be discussed further. 
</p>

<p>
Creating a supportive environment is the responsibility of all student and teacher participants.  Avoid making inappropriate actions or statements based on characteristics such as age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, nationality, political affiliation, ability status, or educational background. Disruptive or harassing behavior of any kind will not be tolerated. Harassment includes but is not limited to inappropriate or intimidating behavior and language, unwelcome jokes or comments, unwanted touching or attention, offensive images, photography without permission, and stalking. Violations of this code of conduct policy should be reported either to meeting organizers or the conference ombudsperson, and may result in the offending person’s dismissal from this program.
